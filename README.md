##Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not using machine learning models. The dataset used contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

### Introduction
This project is a classic beginner machine learning project that uses the Titanic dataset to build a model to predict the survival of passengers. The dataset contains various features that can be used to train the model.

### Dataset
The dataset typically used for this project is available on Kaggle and contains the following information about passengers:
- Survived: Whether the passenger survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- Sex: Sex
- Age: Age in years
- SibSp: Number of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic
- Parch: Number of parents / children aboard the Titanic
- Ticket: Ticket number
- Fare: Passenger fare
- Cabin: Cabin number
- Embarked: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Titanic-Survival-Prediction.git
   cd Titanic-Survival-Prediction
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Normalize numerical features if necessary

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze the dataset to understand relationships between features and the target variable

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create new features or modify existing ones to improve model performance

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Choose and train a machine learning model
   - Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score

### Model Training and Evaluation
The notebook `Model_Training.ipynb` contains the steps for:
- Loading the dataset
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Final evaluation

### Results
The results of the model are saved in the `submission.csv` file. This file contains the predictions of whether a passenger survived or not.
